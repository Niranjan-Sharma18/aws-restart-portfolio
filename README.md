# AWS re/Start labs (my notes) I’m a Computer Science graduate and I’m using this repo to keep my AWS re/Start lab notes in one place. What’s in here:
- short write-ups for each lab
- screenshots as evidence (taken during the labs) Structure:
- `labs/` is grouped by topic (linux, networking, security, databases, aws-services, python)
- each lab has a `README.md` and an `evidence/` folder I’ll keep updating this as I do more labs.
