# 0237 file permissions These are my notes + screenshots from this lab. ## What I did
- Followed the lab instructions and tested things as I went
- Took screenshots along the way (**1** images in `evidence/`) ## What I learned
- Got quicker at navigating Linux (cd/ls/pwd, paths) and managing files.
- Understood permissions/ownership better (chmod/chown) and why it matters for security.
- Learned where to check when something is wrong (processes/services/logs). ## Evidence
Screenshots are in the `evidence/` folder. .
